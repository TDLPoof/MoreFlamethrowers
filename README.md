# More Flamethrowers
This mod adds more flame (or other projectile) throwers to Terraria. The base game has only one, and that too is a pretty niche weapon, so I thought I would add some more.

### Content Coverage:

##### Pre-Hardmode: 10 Flamethrowers
5 Pre-Boss

2 Pre-Skeletron

3 Pre-Wall

##### Hardmode: 7 Flamethrowers

2 Pre-Boss

1 Pre-Plantera

3 Pre-Golem

1 Post-Moonlord

Each of these flamethrowers is in some way unique, and I made sure to add enough to make the flamethrower subclass viable into early Post-Moonlord, if you have any endgame content mods installed companion to this. I of course plan to add more in the future, although given that school starts very soon, I doubt I will find much time until winter.
